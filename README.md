## Site Structure

My website consists of these key pages:

### Home
- Side navigation with cloud-themed buttons
- Sections include:
  - **Welcome**: Introduction with a picture of me and my social media links
  - **About Me**: Personal interests of mine displayed on flippable cards (Get to know me!)
  - **Ineji's World**: An interactive showcase of my cat, Ineji.. cause why not? :)

### Portfolio
- Serves as an extended and more in depth resume. My current resume is compressed to one page making it lose some key details, so this will fix that aspect!
- Includes detailed information on my:
  - Work experience
  - Skills
  - Awards and achievements
  - Education
  - References

### Roadmap (Work in Progress)
- Planned to be a 3D experience showcasing my journey (It's a surprise, so no spoilers!)
- Currently under construction

### Contact

## Features

- Responsive design with mobile-friendly navigation
- GSAP animations in the top navigation bar
