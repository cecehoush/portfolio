<!--  
When a user refreshes a page GitHub Pages doesn't know about the React routes, 
so it looks for a physical file or directory (ex. portfolio or roadmap), which doesn't exist (causing a 404 error).

By redirecting to index.html (the single-page app's entry point), 
React Router takes over and correctly interprets the URL (ex. /portfolio or /roadmap) to display the intended content (based on routing logic in App.js).
